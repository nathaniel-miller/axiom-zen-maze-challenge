Welcome to the first Axiom Zen coding challenge!

In order to speed up your work, we've provided a test harness for each of the
following languages on their own branch:

 - javascript
 - go
 - ruby
 - python
 - java

To get started with one of these languages, use the command "git merge
<language>" to merge the appropriate branch into master. Make your edits,
commit them and push them back to our server and we can evaluate your results!

If you want to use a different language, please send us an email indicate what
language you'd like to use, and why, and we'll let you know if it makes sense.
